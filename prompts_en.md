## Processing Requirements
1. Review the onReceive method code in the current class, analyze the code logic, examine the handling logic for different Actions, and check for security vulnerabilities.
2. If different Action handlers call other methods, continue to review those methods' code, analyze their logic, and check for security vulnerabilities.
3. If security vulnerabilities exist, provide a detailed description of the potential security vulnerability causes, show the vulnerable code, and generate Intent data that can reach the vulnerable branch.
